        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Place butter in a microwave-safe bowl and cover with parchment paper; place a microwave-safe plate over the parchment paper to hold it down. Microwave butter for 5 minutes. Check butter; continue to microwave in 30-second intervals if needed, until butter is golden brown and has released a nutty aroma, an additional 30 to 90 seconds.</li>
          <li>Mix flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl and set aside.</li>
          <li>Beat brown butter, brown sugar, and sugar together in another bowl until smooth and creamy. Add egg and vanilla; mix until well blended. Add flour mixture and chocolate chips; mix until just incorporated. Place dough in a container, cover, and refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours to 24 hours.</li>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
          <li>Scoop cookies with a medium-sized cookie scoop and set on the prepared baking sheet, 2 inches apart.</li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned on the edges, 13 to 15 minutes. Cool briefly on the baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack.</li>
